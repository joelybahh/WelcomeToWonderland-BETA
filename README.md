# Welcome To Wonderland

## Elevator Pitch
A VR challenge where you need to use your wits and puzzle solving skills to survive and escape the galaxy's most dangerous game show and stay one step ahead of its charismatic, crazed, omnipresent host. Welcome to Wonderland.

## Game Concept
Seeking untold riches and fame and fortunes, you have become a contestant on the
Galaxy's most popular and dangerous hit holonet show: Welcome to WONDERLAND.
In this VR adventure, you will be tested in a gauntlet of seemingly never-ending
brain-bending challenges and puzzles as every moment of your suffering is broadcast to the
entire Milky Way by your confident, charismatic and charming host: Wonderland himself.
These puzzles progressively get harder and harder over the duration of the game, re-using
old puzzle tricks and techniques, but with new twists, while also bringing new avant-garde
gameplay into the challenges brought unto the player during their play session.
Your limits will be tested and your spirit will be crushed for the glory of ratings and drama as
the whole galaxy watches on, all wondering: How far are YOU willing to go for it all?
